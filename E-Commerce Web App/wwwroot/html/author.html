        <p>Welcome to my third website for the educational purposes. I hope you will enjoy viewing it because I spent a lot of time to give it a professional look. <br/><br/>
        Let me tell you a bit about myself. <br/><br/> I am an IT student at the Univeristy of Belgrade. Belgrade is also my hometown. I'm 20. <br/><br/> My main interests in Information Techonology are programming, making multimedia stuff and web developing. <br/><br/>
        <b>As I sad earlier this website is only made for educational purposes. Photos were taken from Zara International website.</b> </p><br/>
